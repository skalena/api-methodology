## API Audit
API Audit is a method to ensure APIs are matching the API Design guidelines. It also helps check for usability, security and API management platform compatibility.

## Details about the Process:

 1. **Prototype** - Validate the prototype with the API Audit checklist. Please [download the document here](images/APIAudit_checklist.pdf). 
 2. **Build Just Enough** - Validate the API with  [API Audit](images/APIAudit_checklist.pdf). Use all criteria and check the API also live, with automated tests. Check status codes and errors match with designed.
 3. **Deliver**: Validate the API with  [API Audit](images/APIAudit_checklist.pdf). Make sure your status codes match with changes made because of scaling (like async handling, caching etc.)

 ## Main items to be evaluated in according to the document 

 **API Management**

 - API is published via API management
 - API is visible in a Developer portal
 - API can only be accessed via API management gateway
 - Rate limits are enforced when requesting API
 - Specification is maintained automatically when changes are done to API
 - Specification for endpoints is validated on every change against
standard specification
 - Specification contains schema for the requests and responses
 - Request and response schema and examples are validated for
format and examples pass the schema validation

**URIs**

 - API uses HTTPS (or in special cases other stateless protocol with
encryption)
 - The API published under the organizationâ€™s official domain
Visible domain is shared with other APIs (i.e the domain the API
consumers see?)
 - Endpoints are max 2-resources deep (Example
/projects/123/tasks/345)
Other naming styles in style guide have been applied

**API has versioning**

 - Versioning strategy is best for the selected API management
platform and for the primary API consumers?

 - Major version is in URI (only if API management platform doesn't support versioning
based on client subscription)
- API uses stateless processing (no sessions, OpenID connect
tokens are ok) 
- There is no special processing (asynchronous events)

**HTTP-methods**
-  GET -requests don't have request bodies
- POST is used for creating and updating data?
- POST is used only in standard ways.
- PUT is used to create or replace entire resource?
- DELETE is used only to remove a resource?

** HTTP status codes**
- 404 is used for wrong URL
- 400 - responses have additional information of the specific error
(for example missing required attribute)
- 401 - response is used when API consumer is using wrong
credentials
- 403 using endpoint which is valid but not accessible by the
requesting API consumer or trying to use operation they are not
allowed to do
- 500 - response when there is an internal processing problem  
which API consumer can not fix by changing the request  
- 500 - responses have application specific error code but not a  
very clear plain message about exact error (stack trace or error  
text) which could expose internal implementation to API  
consumer
- GET: 200 OK and items -array as empty array
- GET: 204 empty response, nothing in the body
- POST: 200 OK for updates or submits without creating new  
resources  
- 201 - response is combined with the identifier of the created  
resource  
- DELETE: 204 OK when removing resource was successful

**Localization**

- Date- and time formats in UTC with time zone (ISO standard)
- Language and country codes used with ISO -standard codes?
- Other standard codes applied?
- Geocoordinates in ISO standard if used?
- Payload localization supported or localized values accessible with  
API?  
- Error message localization supported?

**Additional security**

- All endpoints are protected by at least a client specific API key  
even if they are publicly available (anti-farming)?
- OpenID connect and JWT supported (session based  
authentication)?
- Protect against CFRS? (allow API management developer portal  
as origin to allow developers to try out the API via the portal user  
interface)
- Inputs are validated? true
- Inputs are validated automatically by the coding framework used? true
- Outputs are escaped? true
- Outputs are escaped automatically by the coding framework  
used?
- Need for encrypting data has been evaluated before  
implementation? (country-specific privacy and other legal  
requirements and business confidential requirements)
- Encryption of data in transit and data in storage has been  
implemented according to the evaluated need?
- Need to detect message integrity has been evaluated before  
implementation (typically using signed and encrypted JWT -  
tokens as authentication and integrity ensured)?
- Message integrity has been implemented according to the  
evaluated need?

- UUID used to identify object instead of internal ID? true

- Secured direct object references i.e. no sensitive information like  
bank account numbers, social security numbers, person names  
etc. in URL as resource names or query parameters?

- Specification contains examples in the standard format of the  
requests and responses and API documentation is generated  
automatically based on the specification, schema and examples  
POST, PUT: 201 Created for creating new resource true

- 400 bad requests from the client, for example a required query  
parameter was missing  
- Whitelisting: POST, PUT and DELETE are only available for  
resources which API consumer can manipulate?  
- GET requests with longest endpoint-hierarchy and multiple query  
parameters with long values don't exceed 2000 of URI length?  
(Some older clients and browsers may have this type of limit,  
although it is not official limit and newer clients can handle it well)
