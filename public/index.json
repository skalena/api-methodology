They also have solutions to render your API Contract, and also a very interesting way to use Code Generators, either for your API server side and also client side.\nSkalena Tooling for API Contract After several projects and consulting engagements, we decided to use a free solution called Stop Light:\nWe decided to use this tool, simply because we can promote very collaborative sessions with our customers and then define together how we will define the API, exactly which kind of data it will expose, as well as which methods, parameters and in the end, we can check the generated Swagger/OAS file in a very two-way effective manner.\nHere you can get more information as well as to download that tool for your specific OS.\n"

They are embeddable components like legos, in which the edges are connectable via HTTP Protocol.\nAPI First ideates about to draft the ideas starting by the APIs, in common sense, it means that if you have good APIs, you will have great applications.\nEverything starts at the level of the contract, which is the definition of the API\u0026rsquo;s capabilities, in other words: What the API does and how.\nThese definitions are defined under industry standards, which are Open API Specifications (OAS). The definition/contract represented through a JSON or YAML file, and it is commonly called the \u0026ldquo;Swagger file\u0026rdquo;.\nDesigning the API Contracts To create great APIs, always starts on to clear and concise contracts (OAS/Swagger), although, to create those contracts is not an easy task, many misconceptions and learning curve can damage your API contract.\n"

Default and Chapter. Both can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being layout display.\nA Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found under it. You can define any HTML as prefix for the menu. In the example below, it\u0026rsquo;s just a number but that could be an icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Basics\u0026#34; chapter = true weight = 5 pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;1. \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026#34; +++ ### Chapter 1  # Basics Discover what this Hugo theme is all about and the core-concepts behind it. To tell Hugo-theme-learn to consider a page as a chapter, set chapter=true in the Front Matter of the page.\nA Default page is any other content page.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Installation\u0026#34; weight = 15 +++ The following steps are here to help you initialize your new website. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you to train by following this great documentation for beginners.\nCreate your project Hugo provides a new command to create a new website.\nhugo new site \u0026lt;new_project\u0026gt; Hugo-theme-learn provides archetypes to help you create this kind of pages.\nFront Matter configuration Each Hugo page has to define a Front Matter in yaml, toml or json.\nHugo-theme-learn uses the following parameters on top of Hugo ones :\n+++ # Table of content (toc) is enabled by default. Set this parameter to true to disable it. # Note: Toc is always disabled for chapter pages disableToc = \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # If set, this will be used for the page\u0026#39;s menu entry (instead of the `title` attribute) menuTitle = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be prefixed by this HTML content pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be postfixed by this HTML content post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Set the page as a chapter, changing the way it\u0026#39;s displayed chapter = false # Hide a menu entry by setting this to true hidden = false # Display name of this page modifier. If set, it will be displayed in the footer. LastModifierDisplayName = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Email of this page modifier. If set with LastModifierDisplayName, it will be displayed in the footer LastModifierEmail = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; +++ Add icon to a menu entry In the page frontmatter, add a pre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the Github icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Github repo\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#39;fab fa-github\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026#34; +++ Ordering sibling menu/page entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;My page\u0026#34; weight = 5 +++ Using a custom title for menu entries By default, Hugo-theme-learn will use a page\u0026rsquo;s title attribute for the menu item (or linkTitle if defined).\nBut a page\u0026rsquo;s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. We\u0026rsquo;ve added the menuTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Install on Linux\u0026#34; menuTitle = \u0026#34;Linux\u0026#34; +++ Homepage To configure your home page, you basically have three choices:\n Create an _index.md document in content folder and fill the file with Markdown content Create an index.html file in the static folder and fill the file with HTML content Configure your server to automatically redirect home page to one your documentation page  "

	"content": "API Projects Category There are some APIs projects archetypes that we have been noticing:\n The customer has Zero APIs, The customer has some APIs that you have just to do some proxy The customer has a bunch of APIs and you have to do compositions or orchestrations with them Customers asking about: What about this new GraphQL momentum  Customer has Zero APIs That is the scenario where you will have to do important architectural decisions, from adopting a programming language, a platform, a framework, or all together. To understand the existing technology that exists in the customer is crucial do define how you will build your Endpoints.\nIf you had decided to adopt a Microservice Architecture style, keep in mind that you will face not only programming and new paradigms, but also infrastructure challenges, as your customer will at a certain level to embrace numerous new concepts such as CI/CD pipelines, containers, Kubernetes so for so forth.\nAt Skalena we always decided to start with Quick wins, it means, not start with dramatic changes and to do the things in a very controlled pace. Therefore, if you have a savvy customer ahead, great to move the things in a fast way, but we do believe to do the things in according to Agile principles is safer.\nCustomer has some APIs that you have just to Proxy That is a common scenario when companies are moving towards digital, they get first an API Gateway Pattern to act as a central proxy, where you can use it as a unique point for Authentication controlling, as well as some analytics, tracing and monitoring. That is a moment, where just an API Gateway shall be enough for you.\nWhat is important in that point is to understand how you will interact with your client requests, which HTTP headers you should care about, does your payload response must be enriched, changed etc. In that scenario, we extremelly recommend you establish a very simple sequence diagram in order to communicate with your customers, things like the following ones:\nsequenceDiagram Client -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; API Gateway: Send the request with Bearer Auth API Gateway--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Partner Endpoint: Header + Basic Auth Partner Endpoint--x Backend: IP Whitelist via Firewall Note right of Backend: Not exposed to \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;Internet. Simple diagrams like that, can save your time and the communication will be opener\nCustomer with APIs: Compositions or orchestrations It is something very common that you might have ready services/backends, but you must have to do that we call: composite APIs, which means through a unique call to invoke several endpoints right a once.\nIn those scenarios, we have a few options:\n Build a composite Microservice/Service To Use Integration platforms/frameworks, such as WSO2, Apache Camel, Kafka Connectors, or proprietary solutions.  Either scenario would have its drawbacks and advantages, although in our methodology we actually have a preference for the Integrations frameworks/platforms due to productivity and some code generating techniques that we have in place.\nImagine the following scenario:\nsequenceDiagram Client -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; API Gateway: Send the request /order-items API Gateway--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Composite: One request Composite --\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Composite : Aggregating response Composite -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; API Gateway : Aggregating response Composite --\u0026gt;Backend A: requesting 1st Service Backend A --\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Composite:response Composite --\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Backend B:requesting 2nd Service Backend B --\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Composite:response Furthermore, to simply compose services based on existing backends, many other aspects might be intrinsically involved, for instance:\na) Backends developed by different companies or partners might treat authentication and authorization differently.\nb) If you have a set of services, and you have to invoke them all, what happened if some of those fails? In that regard, your new composite service must treat that anyhow. We can use techniques related to circuit-breakers, or simply to define timeouts, according to the use cases, sometimes you can have partial responses (the data coming from responsive backends) and ignore the one that has failed, or there are cases, where it is \u0026ldquo;all or nothing\u0026rdquo; if any of the services does not respond, you can send an HTTP error code with a fault, and making sure that you point which were the service that did not respond properly.\nCustomers asking about: What about this new GraphQL momentum GraphQL is a technogology that is gaing more and more relevance in many organizations around the world.\nSource: https://graphql.org/ GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.\nGraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.\nConsiderations It is a matter of fact that REST model comes with several drawbacks, such as the points mentioned above, however it has come considerable interesting points according to your API Strategy, going straigth to the point: REST APIs are easier to understand which are the avaialable capabilites due to the Swagger/OAS documentations. We have been some companies exposing their services through GraphQL, however we still don\u0026rsquo;t have consierable data about how the developers are engaging with this kind of Developer Portals.\nThat is all about your strategy, some developers(users) might be more proficient, but others rather prefers to get something clear, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out based on a real example about GraphQL:\n... mutation { addAgreementToUser(input: { clientMutationId: \u0026quot;012\u0026quot;, userId: \u0026quot;b1ca0944-7822-3538-920d-58b233154608\u0026quot;, agreementTermId: \u0026quot;e32a7918-eef5-41af-909b-f4c93cee2e22\u0026quot; }) { clientMutationId user { id username firstName lastName displayName agreement { agreementTerm { id title description url } } } } ...  If we compare the above GraphQL instruction with something like:\nHTTP POST http://server/api/v2/agreement body: some JSON  There is a considerable difference.\nRecommendations According to the customer industry, we are recommending our customers to user GraphQL as a tier where we can compose services and expose them via our mediation layer (Microservice) to a REST API:\nsequenceDiagram Client -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; API Gateway: Send the request /order-items API Gateway--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Composition: One request Composition --\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Composition : Aggregating response Composition -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; API Gateway : Aggregating response Composition --\u0026gt;GraphQL: invoking GraphQL instructions GraphQL --\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Composition :response "

Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes\u0026hellip;)\n Let\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\n Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use!  John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\n The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. \u0026ndash; John Gruber Grav ships with built-in support for Markdown and Markdown Extra. You must enable Markdown Extra in your system.yaml configuration file\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nBookmark this page for easy future reference!\n Headings Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Renders to:\nh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading HTML:\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;h1 Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Comments Comments should be HTML compatible\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\nHorizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements.

For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.\nImages Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax\nAlternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026quot;The Dojocat\u0026quot;  Resizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image.

By default lightbox is enabled using the featherlight.js plugin. You can disable this by defining featherlight to false.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png?featherlight=false) "

La seule différence porte sur la personalisation des images (taille, ajout de classes CSS\u0026hellip;) Pour des raisons évidentes, cette page n\u0026rsquo;a pas été traduites en français 😁\n Let\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\n Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use!  John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\n The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. \u0026ndash; John Gruber Grav ships with built-in support for Markdown and Markdown Extra. You must enable Markdown Extra in your system.yaml configuration file\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nBookmark this page for easy future reference!\n Headings Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Renders to:\nh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading HTML:\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;h1 Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Comments Comments should be HTML compatible\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\nHorizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; with any of the following:\n ___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks  renders to:\n   Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.

For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.\nImages Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax\nAlternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026quot;The Dojocat\u0026quot;  Resizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image.

	"content": "This section will cover some interesting API\u0026rsquo;s solutions vendors and some summary about them. In addition, we will classify the kind/stereotype of available solutions.\nDefinitions Here are definitions of terms that will be referred to repeatedly during this article for your reference.\n Proxy – A server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from servers that provide those resources. Reverse Proxy – Type of proxy that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers and then returns these resources to the client, appearing as from the proxy. API Gateway – A system to that receives API requests, performs traffic routing and management to the backend services and returns a response to the client / end user requester. Ingress – Incoming traffic (north/south) to a cluster running your application services. When referred to in Kubernetes environments, an Ingress Controller object exists to specifically fulfill this function. North/South – This direction of traffic is defined as the client to server traffic, between the clients or end users outside of the datacenter to the network inside the datacenter. East/West – The service to service communication that occurs within the cluster and does not leave your network. Service Mesh – An example of east/west traffic using an architecture where a proxy sidecar is deployed alongside each service to manage the traffic. Source: https://solo.io  Commercial Vendors There are several solutions very interesting in the market, we will mention the following ones:\n Sensedia - A Brazilian company that counts with very strong consulting services and a very complete solution. They have so many interesting customers in financial industry, as well very emblematic success cases.

The solutions listed bellow have what they call \u0026ldquo;Community versions\u0026rdquo;, as well as \u0026ldquo;Enterprise Versions\u0026rdquo; with exclusive features.\n Kong - They are by far one of the most known API Gateways in the market. Kong runs on top of NGINX, and it uses Lua(a programming language created in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil), to extend and create its plugins. Kong can be classified as an API Proxy. Actually KongHQ, the company behind Kong Community is actually delivering very interesting components, such as Kubernetes Ingress Controller and other very interesting components. Tyk - A very performatic API Gateway, API Proxy, API Analytics and Developer Portal solution, which according to our evaluation is a great solution for customers looking for a Cloud based solution. According to their Github sources, they are using GoLang to build their solutions. WSO2 - One of the most complete plataforms in API Management industry. They have several components out-of-the-box, such as a Key Manager for generating and validating tokens, as well powerful real-time analytics engine.

It\u0026rsquo;s not replaced with default language content.\n Use slug Front Matter parameter to translate urls too.\n Overwrite translation strings Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme (Edit this page button, Search placeholder and so on). Translations are available in french and english but you may use another language or want to override default values.\nTo override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder i18n/\u0026lt;idlanguage\u0026gt;.toml and inspire yourself from the theme themes/hugo-theme-learn/i18n/en.toml\nBy the way, as these translations could be used by other people, please take the time to propose a translation by making a PR to the theme !\nDisable language switching Switching the language in the browser is a great feature, but for some reasons you may want to disable it.\nJust set disableLanguageSwitchingButton=true in your config.toml\n[params] # When using mulitlingual website, disable the switch language button. disableLanguageSwitchingButton = true "
